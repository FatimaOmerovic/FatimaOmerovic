I'm a Champlain College student studying to be a cybersecurity professional. My experience extends beyond installing and configuring an Elastic Stack, optimizing this stack to identify irregularities in network activity, and ensuring the security of an internal network. Furthermore, I actively supervised the network and investigated a simulated attack on a monitored endpoint, honing my skills in threat detection and response.

I am driven by a passion for continuous learning, actively applying concepts I learn in class to my security job. Beyond learning, I practice self love and watch a classic show, That's So Raven.
